                <p id="aboutc">
                    My name is Willem Ytsma. I was a Mechanical Engineering and Studio Art student at Lafayette College and most recently a <a href="https://te.lehigh.edu/" target="_blank">Technical Entrepreneurship</a> Master's student at Lehigh University. I made this portfolio website to suppliment my résumé and give more in-depth examples of engineering projects I have worked on. What I hope to highlight is how my experiences and education have not only given me a powerful set of analytical tools, but also a unique and creative way of looking at technical problems.
                    <br><br>
                    Solving problems, technical or otherwise, is one of my favorite things to do. I am particulary interested in manufacturing- making things that make other things. I'm not sure what it is about it, I just know I've always liked it. Manufacturing was the focus of my entrepreneurial project in my Master's program. I was (and still am) working on a new process to manufacture vinyl records at a lower cost. Manufacturing and automation is what made me want to become a mechanical engineer.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm not sure how to finish this??
