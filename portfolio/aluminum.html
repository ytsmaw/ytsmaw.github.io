                    <h3>Aluminum Foundry</h3>
                    <p>
                        After my junior year of college, I decided to create an aluminum foundry. I built an insulated charcoal furnace out of two flower pots, sand, and plaster, with plenty of holes to let air in. I used an old soup can as a crucible and attempted to get it hot enough to melt aluminum. Over the next few days, I tried to heat it up but without much success. I only managed to oxidize the aluminum, and then my furnace broke.

                    <p>
                       I took a break from my project when I started my summer internship at FLSmidth, and didn't start up again until I was in my Master's program at Lehigh University. I tried again with my ventilated model mark 2 but it did not get hot enough again and broke. I asked for advice and was told that the secret was forced air. So for mark 3, I made my furnace with a steel pipe at the bottom attached to a pump that I pulled from a broken air mattress. I also incorporated a steel bucket shell so that this model wouldn't shatter like the last two. I turned it on, and waited. At first the coals didn't seem to be getting too hot but soon purple flames were coming out of the top and the chunks of aluminum I had put in my soup can were now liquid.

                        I am using my foundry, along with 3D printing, to fabricate aluminum parts. I print the part I made in SolidWorks, encase it in a plaster investment cast, melt out the print in my foundry, pour in aluminum, and break the mold.
