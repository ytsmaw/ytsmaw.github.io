                    <h3>Aluminum Foundry</h3>
                    <p>
                        For some reason, after my junior year of college, I decided that I wanted to make an aluminum foundry. I told my friend I built it to be "one step closer to God", which I think is the reason why most engineers do what they do. I built an insulated charcoal furnace out of two flower pots, sand, and plaster, with plenty of holes in it to let air in. I used an old soup can as a crucible and attempted to get it hot enough to melt aluminum. Over the next couple of days I went out and tried to heat it up but without much success. I only managed to oxidize the aluminum, and then it broke.

                        I took a break from my project when I started my internship at FLSmidth that summer, and didn't start it up again until I was in my Master's program at Lehigh. I tried again with my ventilated model mk.2 but it didn't get hot enough again and broke again. I asked for advice from someone who I knew had succeeded in melting down aluminum and he told me that the secret was forced air. So for mk.3, I made my furnace with a steel pipe at the bottom attached to a pump that I ripped off of a broken air mattress. I also incorporated a steel bucket shell so that this model wouldn't shatter like the last two. I turned it on, and waited. At first the coals didn't seem to be getting too hot but soon purple flames were coming out of the top and the chunks of aluminum I had put in my soup can were now liquid.

                        The process consumes a soup can every time I use it, but that doesn't bother me much because I eat a lot of soup. I'm using my foundry along with 3D printing to fabricate aluminum parts. All I do is print the part I made in SolidWorks, encase it in a plaster investment cast, melt out the print in my foundry, pour in  aluminum, and break the mold.
