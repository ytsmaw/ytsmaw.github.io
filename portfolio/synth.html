                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Since the 1960s, artists have been using analog synthesizers to produce music. However, synthesizers have always had complex and intimidating interfaces, making them difficult to use. This problem was attempted to be solved with the digital synthesizers of the 80s, using preprogrammed patches based off of samples. These synthesizers were popular for years, but have become unpopular due to their limited capability for experimentation with new sounds. Because of this, many artists are turning back to analog synthesizers but are coming across the same problems they had when they started. Mainly, the inability to save signal paths (patches) and non-intuitive interfaces. Different modules and filters are patched together using audio cables to create a final sound - a process that can take hours or even days. Once the artist decides to move on from a patch, it can become impossible to return to the original sound.

                    <h3>Our Solution</h3>
                    <p>The team spent several weeks interviewing composers and musicians who work heavily with synthesizers to come up with our concept. We considered developing new synthesizer modules, motion-based interfaces, and methods to connect synthesizers to auxilary lightshows. In the end, we found that the most persistant problem for synth users was the inability to recall signal paths that they have made.
