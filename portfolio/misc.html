                    <h3>This Website</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have done quite a bit of web design at an amateur level as projects. <a href="http://anametobeproudof.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">The first website</a> that I built with HTML, where I learned how to code HTML, Javascript, and CSS, was my Tumblr. They have a fun developing tool that I used to make my own Tumblr theme. It has some cool JS code that darkens the background based on the time of day. <a href="https://ytsmaw.github.io/" target="_blank">The second website</a> I made was my GitHub homepage, which my portfolio is a page on. I coded that one in Adobe Dreamweaver and included some fun jquery for mouseover and resize events. The third website I made is this one, though I suppose it is technically part of my second. I'm making this one in <a href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank">Brackets</a> because I didn't really like the UI of Dreamweaver. It's the first one I'm doing with multiple pages and with separate .css and .js files, which has been SUPER helpful.

                    <p>
                        A simple SolidWorks model of a record cartridge that I made based off of photographs I took of one. I did this for a SolidWorks project in my Master's Program. I've also used SolidWorks to make 3D models from dimensioned drawings and as a way to make simple 3D mockups.

                    <h3>Infrared Camera</h3>
                    <p>
                        The summer before my sophomore year of undergrad I decided to make an infrared camera just to see what that would be like. I took apart an old point-and-shoot of mine, replaced the infrared filter with a piece of exposed film (completely black to everything but infrared light), and put it back together. I covered the flash with pieces of exposed film as well to make an invisible, infrared flash.
                    </p><p>
                        When I got a new mirrorless camera I took apart my old one and gave it the same treatment. Except this time I didn't cover the sensor with exposed film, so that I could pick up visible as well as infrared light. I made this so that I could take natural-light photographs in locations without much visible light and still get an image. I also did it so that I could pair it with an infrared flash.
