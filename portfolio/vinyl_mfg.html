                    <h3>The TE Program</h3>
                    <p>Lehigh's Technical Entrepreneurship (TE) program is a master's program that focuses on developing an entrepreneurial venture for a technical product over the course of 12 months. Along the way, we learn about Intellectual Property, finance, creativity techniques, and prototyping methods among other skills. We arrive at our final projects through extensive customer and industry research. In this way, we make sure that the product that we create fulfills a valid market need. The final project I came up with was to develop a new, less expensive method for producing vinyl records. </p>
                    <h3>Problem Outline</h3>
                    <p>The reason I chose to work in Vinyl is becuase it is a growing market, set to be the next billion-dollar industry in 2017, but many artists can't afford to get their music pressed. In my research I found that the smallest amount of money an artist can expect to pay for records is approximately $1000 for a minimum order of 100 records. Over half of this cost, around $600, is devoted to the first two steps in the <a href="https://snugglegruffly.wordpress.com/2017/04/06/how-records-are-made/"> record making process</a>: cutting the master record, and using that positive master to create a negative mold. The rest of the cost is made up from pressing (labor, materials, etc.) and packaging (sleeves, etc.). This high manufacturing cost is proving to be a barrier to entry for thousands of small artists who want to get their music pressed. </p>
                    <h3>My Solution</h3>
                    <p>My solution essentially involves combining the first two steps of the vinyl manufacturing process: cutting a master and making the stamper (mold). This new method will bring down the cost and the lead time of producing a stamper. It is a photolithography- based process that will be able to cut $400 (40%) from the total price of manufacturing a record. Unfortunately, I cannot go into more detail when describing the process because I don't want to limit myself in terms of IP protection. Besides the technical aspect of the project I also developed a business model and a five-year business plan surrounding it for my proposed LLC, ZAG. In May my idea was accepted into Lehigh's <a href="https://www.lehighbakerinstitute.com/iprize">iPrize</a> competition, where I presented and competed for funding. It has also been tentatively accepted as a student research project for <a href="http://ibe.lehigh.edu/">Lehigh's IBE program</a>.</p>
