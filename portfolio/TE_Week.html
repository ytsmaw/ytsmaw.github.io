                    <h3>TE Week</h3>
                    <p>
                        TE Week is the first week of the spring semester of the Technical Entrepreneurship Master's Program at Lehigh University. The goal of TE week is to take a faculty invention that has been patented, find an application for it through customer research, work with the university to draft a mock license agreement, and develop a business plan for the venture, all within one week. I was part of a group of four master's students, along with our faculty advisor.

                    <h3>Our Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        The technology that we had to work with was a new microfluidic separator for condensing nanoparticles for testing. Once we had a solid grasp of the technology and what it did, we began applying creativity techniques to come up with different applications for it. While the original purpose of the device was for separating  nanoparticles out of microliters of blood, we soon came up with ways to use it as a filtration / separation device for larger volumes of liquid. Our final idea was to use it to separate blood into its components during blood donating. We performed customer research for this concept by visiting a local blood bank and talking to the Medical Director.

                    <p>
                        The original device was a very small glass plate with a narrow (50μm), winding channel that separated the blood as it moved through. In order to increase the throughput of the separator I proposed that we straighten out the channels and place thousands of them side-by-side on a much longer plate. The condensed red cells and patelets would be let out through holes in the front face of the plate, while the remaining plasma would be let out through holes in the back face. A device like this would allow for continuous separation as opposed to doing it in batches with a centerfuge. I designed a paper looks-like and an acrylic works-like prototype for this concept.
                    </p><p>
                        Along with developing the product concept with my teammates, I participated in drafting a mock license agreement with Lehigh University for the technology, creating a business plan for the venture, compiling a bill of materials for the product, and preparing a financial model for the business.
