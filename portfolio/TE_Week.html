                    <h3>TE Week</h3>
                    <p>
                        TE Week is the first week of the spring semester of the Technical Entrepreneurship Master's Program at Lehigh University. The goal of TE week is to take a faculty invention that has been patented, find an application for it through customer research, work with the university to draft a mock lisence agreement, and develop a business plan for the venture, all within one week. I was part of a group of four master's students, along with our faculty advisor.

                    <h3>Our Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        The technology that we had to work with was a new microfluidic seperator for condensing nanoparticles for testing. Once we had a solid grasp of the technology and what it did, we began applying creativity techniques to come up with different applications for it.
